    <p id="two">Food Adulteration

Food adulteration is the act of deliberately adding inferior, harmful, or low-quality substances to food items to increase profit. This unethical practice not only reduces the quality of food but also poses serious health risks to consumers. Common examples include mixing water in milk, adding brick powder in chili powder, or using toxic colors in sweets. These adulterants can cause food poisoning, digestive problems, and even long-term diseases like cancer. Despite laws and regular inspections, food adulteration is still common in many places due to lack of awareness and weak enforcement. It is important for consumers to stay alert, check labels, and buy from trusted sources. Strict government actions and public awareness are essential to stop this dangerous practice and ensure safe, healthy food for all.</p>
